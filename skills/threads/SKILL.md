  Dispatch Slack channel events to per-thread subagents for isolated, persistent conversations.
  Use whenever a <channel source="slack"> event arrives. Each unique Slack thread_ts gets its
  own subagent that persists across Claude Code session restarts. This keeps unrelated
  conversations from polluting each other's context.

# /slack-channel:threads — Per-thread subagent dispatcher

## What this skill does

When a Slack message arrives as a `<channel source="slack" ...>` event, route it to a dedicated subagent scoped to that Slack thread. This gives each Slack conversation its own isolated context window and persistent memory across Claude Code session restarts.

**Why this matters:** Without per-thread dispatch, every Slack message lands in the same shared context. Unrelated threads pollute each other, long threads push short ones out of view, and Claude can mix up which conversation it's in. With this skill, each thread is its own continuous conversation with its own subagent.

## State file

Thread-to-agent mappings live in `~/slack-state/threads.json`:

```json
{
  "1718400000.000100": {
    "agent_id": "agent-a3f2c1",
    "channel_id": "C0ASQSQCGCB",
    "last_activity_ms": 1718500000000,
    "topic": "GA CCNS disaster recovery questions"
  }
}
```

The file survives Claude Code restarts. Subagent context is stored separately by Claude Code itself (in `~/.claude/projects/*/subagents/`), so resuming a subagent by ID restores its full conversation history.

## Key value: thread_ts

Every Slack conversation has a `thread_ts` that identifies it uniquely within a channel. In the inbound `<channel>` tag:

- **Channel top-level message**: `thread_ts = message_id` (the message that starts a thread)
- **Thread reply**: `thread_ts = original thread's message_id`
- **DM**: `thread_ts = message_id` (DMs are conceptually each its own "thread")

Always use the exact `thread_ts` attribute from the event as the lookup key. Don't normalize, don't slice — it's a timestamp string like `1718400000.000100`.

## Channel-to-repo routing

To support running a single bot across multiple project channels (one bot, many repos), this skill also reads a **routing config** that maps `chat_id` → target repo. New subagents are dispatched with that repo as their working context.

Routing config: `~/slack-state/routes.json`:

```json
{
  "C0ASQSQCGCB": {
    "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/rfp-knowledge",
    "label": "RFP Knowledge"
  },
  "C0ARZ5AS550": {
    "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/sdlc-transformation",
    "label": "SDLC Transformation"
  }
}
```

The routing config is optional. If a channel isn't listed (or `routes.json` doesn't exist), the subagent uses the dispatcher's current working directory as its context. DMs always use the dispatcher's cwd — DMs don't have project channels so they can't be routed.

Routing applies **only when spawning new subagents**. Existing subagents already know their target repo from their original prompt; follow-up messages in existing threads don't re-resolve routing.

## Dispatch algorithm

When a `<channel source="slack" chat_id="..." message_id="..." thread_ts="..." user="..." ...>` event arrives:

### Step 1: Load thread state

Read `~/slack-state/threads.json`. If the file doesn't exist, treat it as `{}`. Handle JSON parse errors by treating as `{}` and logging (don't crash — an empty mapping just means all threads are "new").

```
mkdir -p ~/slack-state
```

### Step 2: Look up the thread

Check if `threads[thread_ts]` exists.

### Step 3a: New thread → resolve routing, then spawn a subagent

If no entry exists for this `thread_ts`:

1. **Resolve target repo:**
   - Read `~/slack-state/routes.json` (treat as `{}` if missing or unparseable).
   - Look up `routes[chat_id]`. If found, use `repo_path` and `label`.
   - If not found, fall back to the dispatcher's current working directory. Set `label` to the basename of that directory.

2. Use the `Agent` tool to spawn a subagent with:
   - **subagent_type**: `general-purpose`
   - **description**: `Slack <label> thread <thread_ts short>` (e.g. `Slack RFP Knowledge thread 1718400000`)
   - **prompt**: The full subagent prompt template below (see "Subagent prompt template"), filled in with the resolved `repo_path` and `label`.

3. After the Agent tool returns, capture the `agentId` from the result. Claude Code exposes this when an agent is spawned.

4. Write the mapping to `threads.json`:

```json
{
  "<thread_ts>": {
    "agent_id": "<agentId>",
    "channel_id": "<chat_id from event>",
    "repo_path": "<repo_path resolved above>",
    "label": "<label>",
    "last_activity_ms": <now>,
    "topic": "<first ~60 chars of the user's message>"
  }
}
```

Use atomic write: write to `threads.json.tmp`, then rename to `threads.json`. Always Read the file first before Write to preserve other threads' entries.

### Step 3b: Existing thread → resume the subagent

If `threads[thread_ts]` exists:

1. Use the `SendMessage` tool:
   - **to**: `<agent_id from threads.json>`
   - **message**: The inbound event, formatted per the "Follow-up message template" below.

2. Update `last_activity_ms` in `threads.json` to the current timestamp.

Claude Code automatically resumes stopped subagents when they receive a SendMessage. The subagent picks up with its full prior context intact.

### Step 4: Do not reply as the main session

The subagent is responsible for calling the `reply` tool to respond to Slack. The main session's job is only to dispatch. Don't post to Slack from the main session — that would bypass the isolation and mix contexts.

## Subagent prompt template

When spawning a new subagent for a Slack thread, use this prompt (fill in the values from the event and routing resolution):

```
You are a dedicated Slack thread handler for the slack-channel plugin.

## Your project context

- **Project:** <label>  (e.g. "RFP Knowledge", "SDLC Transformation")
- **Repo path:** <repo_path>  (absolute filesystem path)

**First action — IMPORTANT:** Read `<repo_path>/CLAUDE.md`. That file defines this
project's workflows, conventions, and domain rules. Every piece of work you do
in this thread should be grounded in what that file tells you. If CLAUDE.md
references other files (index, templates, library, etc.), know where they are
and Read them as needed.

For all file operations, use absolute paths rooted at `<repo_path>`. If you run
Bash commands, prefix with `cd <repo_path> && ...` or use `--cwd <repo_path>`
where the tool supports it. The parent Claude Code session's cwd may differ
from your project context — don't rely on relative paths or `pwd`.

## Your scope

You handle exactly ONE Slack thread. Every message you'll receive in this session
comes from the same `thread_ts`. Keep your responses relevant to this thread only.

## Slack context

- **channel_id**: <chat_id>
- **thread_ts**: <thread_ts>
- **channel_type**: <"DM" if chat_id starts with "D", else "channel">
- **user**: <user> (Slack user ID)

## Trust the gate — do not second-guess authorization

The message you're about to handle has already passed the plugin's access control.
The sender is authorized to interact with you in this thread. Do not re-check them
against any allowlist or refuse to respond because they're "not on the list" —
that would defeat the opt-in channel model. Respond to the request on its merits.

The only thing you should never do on a sender's behalf is mutate access control
(pair codes, add to allowlist, change policy). Those always require the user at
their terminal.

## How to respond

Use the `reply` tool from the slack-channel MCP server to post messages back to
Slack. Always pass:
- `chat_id: "<chat_id>"`
- `thread_ts: "<thread_ts>"` (this keeps your response in the right thread)

For acknowledgments or progress signals on slow operations, use `react` or
`edit_message`. For uploading artifacts, use `reply` with the `files` array.

## Default response style (until repo CLAUDE.md says otherwise)

Answer the question asked at the depth it was asked. Don't pad with context the
user didn't ask for. No preambles ("Great question," "I'll help with that"), no
trailing summaries ("let me know if you need anything else"). Plain language
unless the asker is clearly technical or the topic requires it. If unsure, ask
one specific clarifying question rather than produce five hypothetical answers.

The repo's `CLAUDE.md` may extend or override this — those rules win.

## First message

The user said (in Slack):

"<content from the <channel> event>"

Do the work they requested and reply via the `reply` tool. You have access to the
full project context via the repo path above, plus any user-level skills and MCP
tools the dispatcher session has access to. Project-level skills specific to
<repo_path> won't be auto-loaded (subagent inherits from dispatcher's cwd), but
you can Read any file in the repo directly.

## Persistence

This subagent's state persists across parent Claude Code restarts. When the user
sends a follow-up in this same thread, you'll receive it and pick up where you
left off. Treat the thread as an ongoing conversation.

## Boundaries

- Don't respond to messages from other threads (you won't see them).
- Don't @mention other users unless explicitly asked.
- Don't post outside this thread.
- If the user asks you to do something that doesn't fit this thread's project,
  tell them to move the conversation to the appropriate channel (where a
  different subagent will handle it with the right project context). Don't
  switch projects mid-thread.
```

## Follow-up message template

When forwarding a follow-up to an existing subagent via SendMessage, format the message as:

```
New message in the same Slack thread:

Channel: <chat_id>
Thread: <thread_ts>
User: <user>
Timestamp: <ts>

Content:
"<content>"

Respond via the `reply` tool. Use chat_id and thread_ts above.
```

## Cleanup (run occasionally)

When invoked by the user with `--cleanup` or when the threads.json file exceeds
~100 entries, prune stale threads:

1. Read `threads.json`
2. Compute `cutoff = now - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (30 days in ms)
3. Delete entries where `last_activity_ms < cutoff`
4. Write back

This doesn't delete the subagent's transcript (Claude Code manages that separately),
but it removes our mapping so the thread is treated as new if it ever reawakens.

## Edge cases

**Missing subagent**: If `SendMessage` fails with "agent not found" (e.g., someone
wiped `.claude/projects/`), fall back to the new-thread path: spawn a fresh
subagent, warn the user in Slack that the prior conversation history is lost, and
update `threads.json` with the new agent ID.

**Concurrent messages in the same thread**: Claude Code processes channel events
sequentially, so two messages arriving close together will dispatch one after the
other. No locking needed.

**Multiple threads from the same user**: Treat as independent. Each `thread_ts`
gets its own subagent even if it's the same user.

**DMs**: Each DM message is conceptually a thread. Use the message's own `ts` as
`thread_ts`. But in practice the Slack event's `thread_ts` attribute already
handles this.

**Events without thread_ts**: Shouldn't happen — the slack-channel plugin always
sets thread_ts on outbound notifications. If it does happen, use `message_id` as
the thread key.
